      challenge="Most teams underestimate how hard it is to translate generative ai integration from a one-off project into a repeatable, production-grade capability the rest of the business actually trusts. Pilots stall in isolation, ownership scatters, and the value case quietly drifts back to the slide deck it started from."
      opportunity="Done well, generative ai integration compounds — every iteration sharpens the operating model, lowers cost, and unlocks the next set of decisions leadership has been deferring. Our AI-Powered Acceleration team brings the engineering rigor, design sensibility, and change-management muscle needed to move from one-off project to durable capability your team can keep evolving."
