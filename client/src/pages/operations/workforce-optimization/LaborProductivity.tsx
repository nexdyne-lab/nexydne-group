      challenge="Operations leaders know labor productivity can unlock material value, yet the gap between intent and execution is wide. Legacy processes, fragmented data, and unclear ownership keep performance well below potential — and small fixes rarely move the needle on their own."
      opportunity="A focused labor productivity program — grounded in workforce optimization fundamentals and powered by modern analytics — can compress cycle times, lift quality, and free working capital. The teams that win treat this as a multi-year capability build, not a one-off project."
