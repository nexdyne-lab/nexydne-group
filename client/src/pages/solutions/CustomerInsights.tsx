                Most enterprise insight functions are graded on output volume — dashboards launched, KPIs tracked, decks produced. The leaders we work with grade on a different metric: how many executive decisions per quarter were measurably informed by the function. The delta between the two grading systems is the difference between an insight team that owns the customer narrative and one that gets cut in the next reorg.

                We rebuild insight functions around the questions executives actually act on. The dashboard count goes down. The narrative artifact gets written. The data access surface gets engineered so the analysts stop waiting on tickets. The cadence holds. And the function shifts from a reporting cost center to a customer-strategy seat at the table — which is the only durable position an insight team has ever held.
