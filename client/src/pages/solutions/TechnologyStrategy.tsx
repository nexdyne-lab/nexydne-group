                Most technology strategies do not fail in the document — they fail in the cadence. The vision is fine, the principles are inoffensive, the architecture diagrams are crisp. Six months later the next platform decision still gets made by whoever shouts loudest in the steering committee, and the strategy quietly stops being referenced. Without governance and decision rights, a strategy is a deck.

                We build technology strategies that are designed to be invoked. The principles are sharp enough to actually decide trade-offs. The target architecture is opinionated enough to reject things. The governance operating model has written decision rights and a fast escalation path. The CIO and CTO get a rhythm they can run for years, not an artifact that ages until the next consulting firm replaces it.
