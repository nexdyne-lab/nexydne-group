                Most CRO programs we are brought in to fix have the same shape: the team is running whichever test the loudest stakeholder asked for last week, the win/loss readouts are inconclusive because the runtimes were never sized for the effect they were testing, and the program has produced nothing statistically significant in nine months. CRO is not an act of taste. It is an operating discipline.

                The leaders we work with run CRO as a hypothesis pipeline. Every hypothesis is tied to a baseline metric and a sized lift. Every test has a written runtime and guardrail metrics. Every concluded test produces a readout that lives in the win/learn library. The program runs at compounding velocity because the discipline is built into the operating cadence — not held together by the senior PM's working memory.
