                Most pricing decisions we are brought in to fix were made the same way: someone looked at a competitor's published price page, the team rounded down a couple of percent, and the discount authority quietly drifted into the deal desk over the next six quarters. By the time leadership notices, realized ASP is 30 percent below list and the team treats the discount as part of the product.
