                The migrations we get called into rescue all share the same opening mistake — the program treated every workload as a candidate, the discovery deferred to a tool inventory, and the 6Rs decision was made by whichever architect was loudest in the room. The waves shipped, the bill exploded, and twelve months in nobody could explain why some applications were running 30 percent more expensive in cloud than they were on-premise.

                A migration done right earns the right to migrate each workload before it commits a single rehearsal. The 6Rs decision is the contract — written, defended, and traceable to the business case. The target architecture is the blueprint the engineering teams build against, not a slide deck. The migration plan is sequenced around blast radius, not the project manager's calendar. The result is a migration that lands on time, holds its cost case, and leaves an operating estate the organization can actually run.
